# TODO

to implement musicbrainz cover art archive (CAA), will require some sort of
manual intervention from the user, keeping in mind this application is mainly in
terminal, displaying image for the prompt would be difficult (i know TGP, sixel
exists, but its unreliable).

# Steps

 1.  get MBID
[2]. find the correct release (album), there is also multiple version of this
        (e.g. for different country release), so we need user interaction
[3]. find the correct recording, since a release may contain multiple recording
        (example: https://musicbrainz.org/recording/96685213-a25c-4678-9a13-abd9ec81cf35)
        for this case, we choose the 20th anniversart ed. made in UK
        (https://musicbrainz.org/release/2755bfc1-9438-4ae8-8a49-3f820dbca482/disc/1#884b2747-478c-34f1-adee-0702bdc1e2ae)
 4.  then we finally get to the track

[n]: require user interaction
